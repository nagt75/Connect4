## Game description

Connect-Four is a two-player game in which players alternately place pieces on a vertical board 7 columns across and 6 rows high. Each player uses pieces of a particular color (red and yellow), and the object is to be the first to obtain four pieces in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal line. Because the board is vertical, pieces inserted in a given column always drop to the lowest unoccupied row of that column. As soon as a column contains 6 pieces, it is full and no other piece can be placed in the column.

## Connect-four Rules
1. Player One starts the game by clicking any circle in the top row.
2. Then Player Two takes turn
3. Each Player should click only once in their turn.
4. The game will continue until a winning combination of four is reached by player One or player Two, or until the grid is full and no winning combination was found.
